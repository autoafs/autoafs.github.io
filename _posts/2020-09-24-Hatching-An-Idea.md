title: Hatching An Idea

My friends play Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Draft every season. Let me translate American friends, think Fantasy Football but with Soccer. Anyways, I've refused to join for the past 7 years because I always end up drafting a player from a rival team. Inevitably, somewhere along mid-season I find myself rooting for that player against my favorite team, Manchester United. The guilt eats me alive. It's awful.

This year, I caved. We go through the draft and I don't recognize 90% of the players. Despite my struggles I land a decent team. I think to myself, "I think I got this."

*Wrong.*

I lose the first week's matchup 41-38. I realize that I can't do this by myself. So, I turn to the internet and all it's wisdom. I find a pretty nifty website, Rotowire. They have rankings and projections every week that helps clueless people like me pick their teams.

Awesome! Now I can just cross check players against Rotowire projections and pick up free agents and build the statistically best team. Easy peasy, right?

*Wrong.*

Going back and forth from the Fantasy Premier League Draft website and Rotowire website is tedious. It involves a series of Ctrl+F commands. I get tired of it easily. Then I remember something, "Hey, I know how to code. Maybe I can just make a chrome extension to overlay the Rotowire projections on the FPL Draft website right?"
