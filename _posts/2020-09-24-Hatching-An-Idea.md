My friends play [Fantasy Premier League Draft](https://draft.premierleague.com/) every season (think Fantasy Football, but with Soccer). I've refused to join them for 7 years now. Why? Because, I always end up drafting a player from a team I "sports hate". There's nothing worse than rooting for said player in the middle of a season when they are playing a crucial game against my favorite team, Manchester United. The guilt eats me alive. This year, I caved.<br><br>

The season starts. We go through the draft and I don't recognize 90% of the players. Clearly, I have lost touch in the last 7 years. Despite my struggles I land a decent team. I think to myself, "I got this".<br><br>

*Wrong.*<br><br>

I lose my first matchup 41-38. I realize that I can't do this by myself. I don't know how to field a team that can win this fantasy league. So, I turn to the internet and all it's wisdom. I find a pretty nifty website called [Rotowire](https://www.rotowire.com/soccer/column.php?id=188). They have rankings and projections every week that help clueless people like me pick their teams.<br><br>

Awesome! Now I can just cross check players against Rotowire projections and pick up free agents and build the statistically best team. Easy peasy, right?<br><br>

*Wrong.*<br><br>

Going back and forth from the Fantasy Premier League Draft website and Rotowire website is tedious. It involves a series of Ctrl+F commands. The official website only ever shows 10 players at a time. I get tired of it all easily. There's no hope for me.<br><br>

Then, I remember something, "Hey, I know how to code. Maybe I can just make a chrome extension that overlays the Rotowire projections on the FPL Draft website right?"<br><br>
